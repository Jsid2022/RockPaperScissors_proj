# RockPaperScissors_proj
Hello Everyone!
This is my first JavaScript Project(Rock, Paper or Scissors)

About Project: There are two players in this Game(one is Computer which will select random String value from "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors", and Second one is you). When you will run this project a prompt will pop up on your screen asking to input a value from rock, paper or scissors. There are Total five rounds in this game.

Rules of the Game:
1. Rock beats Scissors
2. Paper beats Rock
3. Scissors beat Paper

Result of the Game: After the fifth Round Your's and Computer score will be computed, If your Score is greater than Computer's Then you win the game otherwise Computer win the game. If your's and computer's scores are equal then it was a close game(draw).

I want help in this project, I m facing a problem if its a draw between computerChoice and playerChoice then prompt should ask for playerChoice again.
or You have a better Solution for this game then please feel free to give suggestions. Your Help will mean a lot to me.
Thank you.
